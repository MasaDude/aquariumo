            Those require a good filteration system and to fill the aquarium itself <br> with media, fish, decoration
            parts so you can not see this huge aquarium looks empty.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="baqua">
            They also require a good filteration system but it could be smaller than <br> the first one, 
            they would be much better if you filled them with <br> sea or slat water and surely
            seafish and sea environment

            They also require a good filteration system but not as the previous ones.<br> Spongy filter with a good 
            size is very good and efficient you can also put a powerhead filter. <br>
            Fill them with aquatic plants and enjoy I find this size as <br> the most suitable size for aquatic plants.

                Each aquarium needs a proper treatment before you buy one,  <br>
                you must search and choose the suitable size. <br>
                After choosing your aquarium you must find fish type that fits <br>
                your aquarium size. After that you can search and choose the <br>
                aquarium environment that fits with your fish type it's <br>
                a very important point. Then, you have to wait so   the Biological <br>
                period takes place and then you can make a good environment for your fish. <br>
                It's important to choose a good filteration system, good nutrition <br>
                and good water.
